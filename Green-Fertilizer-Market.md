Organic farming is gaining popularity due to its focus on healthier food production and reduced environmental impact. Green fertilizers are a key component of this farming method, emphasizing sustainability and ecologically friendly practices.

Factors such as farmer demographics, economic incentives, and social, cultural, and institutional factors influence adoption. Financial incentives like subsidies and price premiums for organic products, along with support from public agricultural service providers and non-governmental organizations, also encourage adoption.  Green fertilizers’ high cost and potentially lower nutrient concentrations are deterring farmers from large-scale organic farming due to higher costs compared to synthetic fertilizers.
