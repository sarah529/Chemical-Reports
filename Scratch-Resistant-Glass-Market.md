Consumer demand has led to the adoption of scratch-resistant glass in other industries, such as the automotive industry, where it is being used in windshields and windows to prevent damage from road hazards. As a result, there is a rising need for durable and long-lasting products in a wide range of industries, including eyewear and industrial applications. With the advancement of technology and the increasing reliance on electronic devices, the demand for scratch-resistant glass is expected to continue to grow in the future.

The production of scratch-resistant glass is quite expensive due to the intricate manufacturing process involved. This results in relatively higher prices for scratch-resistant glass products, which may make them less attractive to budget-conscious consumers. Furthermore, during the anticipated period, the market for scratch-resistant glass is expected to face tough competition from alternative materials such as plastic and polycarbonate.

“The rising demand for high-quality materials is reshaping the scratch-resistant glass market, especially in the electronics industry, where screens need protection against scratches and cracks. This type of glass is increasingly sought-after due to its ability to safeguard devices from damage, translating to enhanced durability and longer lifespans. This trend indicates a significant shift towards prioritizing longevity and performance, driving further growth in the scratch-resistant glass sector,” says an analyst at FMI.
