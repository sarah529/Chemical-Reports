The growth of the chemical and petrochemical industries is another factor contributing to the demand for sulphur.

With the global economy’s expansion, the demand for chemicals and petrochemicals is also projected to rise, further fueling the growth of the solid sulphur market.

The rising demand for sulphur in animal feed production is also a significant driver for the growth of the solid sulphur market. Sulphur is an essential nutrient for livestock, commonly added to animal feed as a supplement. As the global demand for meat and dairy products continues to increase, the demand for sulphur in animal feed is also expected to rise, contributing further to the growth of the solid sulphur market.

 “The market is expected to continue growing in the coming years, driven by a combination of factors. These factors include the increasing demand for sulphur-based fertilizers, the growth of the chemical and petrochemical industries, and the rising demand for sulphur in animal feed production, “says an analyst at FMI.
