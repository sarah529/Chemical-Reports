# Composite Door and Window Market to Hit USD 1.7 Billion by 2034, Growing at a CAGR of 7.4%

The composite door and window market is anticipated to be valued at USD 0.83 billion by 2024. The market valuation is estimated to be USD 1.7 billion by 2034, projected at a CAGR of 7.4%.

The increasing demand for energy-efficient building materials is one of the primary drivers. Composite doors and windows offer superior thermal insulation properties, helping to reduce heat loss and energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings.
As energy efficiency regulations become more stringent worldwide, a growing preference for composite materials can contribute to sustainable construction practices and lower utility costs for building owners.

Composite materials provide excellent durability and resist weathering, corrosion, and rotting, making them ideal for exterior applications such as doors and windows. Homeowners and architects appreciate the low maintenance requirements of composite doors and windows, which typically require minimal upkeep compared to traditional materials.
